# 👋 Hi, I'm Reinel Torres

**Full Stack & AI Engineer** | Hands-on Backend Leader | Distributed Systems | AWS Expert

I'm a software engineer with over 15 years of experience designing scalable, cloud-native platforms — from AI-powered crop prediction systems to secure, multi-tenant SaaS applications. I thrive in technical leadership roles where clean architecture, automation, and smart ML integrations make a real difference.
